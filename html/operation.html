<p><strong>GSM Based Theft Control System for Automobiles</strong>
This GSM based anti-theft system for cars, this project uses a GSM technology and also different sensors like an obstacle, vibration, battery sensors, micro switches, and rotation sensors.

This system gets ON when vibration occurs, the battery gets ignited, any of the front doors remaining open or any obstacle comes in any particular area.<a href="https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4.jpg">GSM based theft control systrem for Automobiles</a>. If any of these parameters are sensed, the microcontroller sends the commands to the buzzer, the GSM modem, and the LCD. Here, the MAX232 acts as an interface between the microcontroller and the GSM modem.

The MAX232 acts as an interface between the GSM modem and the microcontroller to change the TTL signals to RS232 signals. The microcontroller acts as a heart of the owl system, that accepts the signals from these sensors and sends the signals to the GSM modem and alerts the buzzer. Then, sends that information to the owner of the car.

Thus, these are GPS and GSM  based vehicle theft control system projects by implementing these vehicle security system projects, a vehicle can be protected from thefts. In the future, this anti-theft system for cars will be enhanced to function as an integrated-data-security system for car communication systems. It would ensure that all the data exchanged within the vehicle and outside the vehicle is protected. Furthermore any queries regarding this concept or electronics project.
