<p>My project is about vehicle tracking by GPS and GSM.The main intention of this project is to find out the exact location of the stolen vehicle by thefts and inform to the concerned authority through an SMS.This GSM based vehicle theft control system retrieves the exact location of a vehicle in terms of its longitude and latitude. This data is fed to the microcontroller, that is interfaced with a GSM modem. The microcontroller retrieves the exact location details from the GPS and sends an SMS to the concerned authority over GSM modem on periodical intervals which are set by the user. An LCD is connected to the microcontroller for crossing the data received before being sent over GSM. This project will be very useful for people to keep track of their vehicles. Further, this project can be developed by arranging to stop the ignition of the vehicle by the owner remotely by sending an SMS in theft situations.</p>
